In order, to use the differents elements of our OCR you have to
build an exe in the concern folder and you just have to load it
with an image in argument for the preprocessing and the segmentation
and with a number for the neural network.


Now if you want to have an interface with buttons link you
just have to build at the root with "make ocr". You just have 
to load the gui.exe.
